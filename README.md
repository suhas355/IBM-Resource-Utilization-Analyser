# IBM-Resource-Utilization-Analyser

Purpose 
           Objective of project is to build a resource utilization analyzer for server farms. This tool can be used to analyze the usage patterns of servers over time in server farms and help manage the available resources better. 
The time stamped utilization data from each server (like memory usage, cpu usage , network load etc) can be stored in a informix database using Informix time series data blade and analyzed quickly because of inherent performance provided by the time series data blade. 



It mainly contains three actors.
 To fetch resource information from the client.
 To analyse and store the status.
 To provide information of status to the manager
